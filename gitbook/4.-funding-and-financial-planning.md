Securing adequate funding is a crucial aspect of your PhD journey. In this chapter, we'll explore various funding options available for Computer Science PhD students in Germany, compare different types of financial support, discuss living costs, and provide tips on budgeting for academic expenses.

### A. Types of Funding

Germany offers several funding options for PhD students, each with its own advantages and considerations.

#### 1. University Positions (e.g., wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter)

* **Description**: Many PhD students in Germany are employed as research assistants (wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter) at universities or research institutions.
* **Pros**:
  * Regular salary (typically 50-100% of the TV-L E13 pay scale)
  * Social benefits (health insurance, pension contributions, unemployment insurance)
  * Integration into the university system
* **Cons**:
  * Teaching or administrative duties alongside research
  * Usually limited to 3-5 years
* **Application Process**: Often tied to specific projects or advertised positions

#### 2. Scholarships (e.g., DAAD, DFG)

* **DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service)**
  * Offers various scholarships for international PhD students
  * Provides monthly stipends, travel allowances, and sometimes language course funding
  * Application deadlines vary, often once or twice a year
* **DFG (German Research Foundation)**
  * Primarily funds research projects, which may include PhD positions
  * Also offers the "Research Training Groups" (Graduiertenkollegs) program
* **Other Options**:
  * Alexander von Humboldt Foundation
  * State-specific scholarships
  * University-specific scholarships

#### 3. Industry-Sponsored PhDs

* **Description**: Collaboration between universities and companies, where the company funds the PhD research
* **Pros**:

* Common for scholarship holders

**Employment Contracts**:

* Taxed as regular income
* Higher gross amount, but net income may be similar to stipends after taxes
