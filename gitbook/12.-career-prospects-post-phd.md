# 12. Career Prospects Post-PhD

### A. Academic Career Paths in Europe

For those passionate about research and teaching, academia offers a rewarding career path.

1. **Postdoctoral Positions**: Often the first step post-PhD, postdoc positions allow you to deepen your research expertise and build your publication record.
   * Duration: Typically 2-3 years
   * Where to look: University job boards, academic job portals like Academic Positions, EURAXESS
2. **Junior Professorship**: A tenure-track position unique to Germany, equivalent to Assistant Professor in other systems.
   * Duration: Usually 6 years, with the possibility of transitioning to a full professorship
   * Key aspect: Combines independent research with teaching responsibilities
3. **Lecturer/Senior Lecturer**: Focus more on teaching, with some research responsibilities.
   * Common in: UK, Netherlands, Scandinavia
   * Progression: Can lead to Reader or Professor positions
4. **Full Professorship**: The pinnacle of an academic career.
   * Requirements: Typically need a strong research record, teaching experience, and in Germany, often a Habilitation (a second, higher doctorate)
5. **Research Scientist at Universities or Research Institutes**: For those who prefer research over teaching.
   * Examples: Max Planck Institutes, Fraunhofer Society, Helmholtz Association

**Pro Tip**: Build a strong network during your PhD. Many academic positions are filled through personal connections and recommendations.
