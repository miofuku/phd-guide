# 13. Resources and Support

### A. University Support Services

Most European universities, especially in Germany, offer a wide range of support services for PhD students. These can include:

1. **International Offices**: These offices are your first point of contact for issues related to visas, accommodation, and general integration into university life.
2. **Graduate Schools**: Many universities have dedicated graduate schools that offer additional training, workshops, and networking opportunities.
3. **Career Services**: These offices provide guidance on career planning, CV writing, and job search strategies, both for academic and industry positions.
4. **Psychological Counseling**: Free or subsidized counseling services are often available to help students manage stress and maintain mental health.
5. **Language Centers**: Most universities offer language courses, including intensive German courses for international students.
6. **Research Support Offices**: These can help with grant applications, ethics approvals, and other research-related administrative tasks.
7. **IT Services**: For computer science students, robust IT support and access to high-performance computing resources are often available.

**Pro Tip**: Make a point to familiarize yourself with these services early in your PhD. Don't wait until you're in crisis to seek support!

### B. Professional Associations and Networks

Joining professional associations can provide valuable networking opportunities, access to resources, and stay updated with the latest developments in your field. Some key associations for CS PhD students in Europe include:

1. **Gesellschaft f√ºr Informatik (GI)**: The German Informatics Society, which organizes conferences and provides networking opportunities.
2. **Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)**: While based in the US, it has a strong European presence and offers student memberships with access to digital libraries and conferences.
3. **IEEE Computer Society**: Offers networking, conferences, and publications in various CS specializations.
4. **European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS)**: Focuses on theoretical computer science research.
5. **EUROCRISE**: The European Association for Computer Science Research and Education.

**Networking Tip**: Attend conferences and workshops organized by these associations. They're great opportunities to present your work, learn about cutting-edge research, and network with peers and potential employers.

### C. Online Resources and Communities

The internet offers a wealth of resources for CS PhD students. Here are some valuable online platforms:

1. **ResearchGate**: A social networking site for scientists and researchers to share papers, ask and answer questions, and find collaborators.
2. **arXiv.org**: An open-access repository of electronic preprints, particularly useful for CS research.
3. **Stack Overflow**: While primarily for coding questions, it also has a computer science theory community.
4. **CS Theory Stack Exchange**: A question and answer site for theoretical computer science.
5. **r/CSCareerQuestions** and **r/GradSchool** on Reddit: Forums for discussing career and graduate school topics.
6. **GitHub**: Beyond code hosting, it's a great place to find open-source projects to contribute to and showcase your work.
7. **DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) Website**: Offers comprehensive information about studying and researching in Germany.

**Online Etiquette Tip**: When engaging in online communities, always be respectful and professional. Your online presence can impact your professional reputation.

### D. Mentoring Programs

Mentoring can be a crucial factor in your success as a PhD student. Many universities and organizations offer mentoring programs:

1. **University Mentoring Programs**: Many German universities have formal mentoring programs pairing PhD students with more experienced researchers or professors.
2. **Women in Computer Science Mentoring**: Programs like the ACM-W (ACM's Council on Women in Computing) offer mentoring specifically for women in CS.
3. **Industry Mentoring Programs**: Companies like Google, Microsoft, and IBM often have mentoring programs for PhD students.
4. **Peer Mentoring**: Some universities facilitate peer mentoring groups where more advanced PhD students mentor newcomers.
5. **International Mentoring**: Programs like Mentor Net offer global mentoring opportunities.

**Mentoring Tip**: Don't limit yourself to just one mentor. Different mentors can provide diverse perspectives on research, career development, and work-life balance.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Familiarize yourself with your university's support services early in your PhD journey.
* Join professional associations relevant to your research area for networking and resources.
* Engage actively but professionally in online communities to expand your network and knowledge.
* Seek out mentoring opportunities, both within your university and through external programs.

**Action Points:**

1. Schedule a meeting with your university's international office to learn about available support services.
2. Join at least one professional association in your field.
3. Set up profiles on key online platforms like ResearchGate and GitHub.
4. Apply for a mentoring program or approach a potential mentor in your department.

Remember, pursuing a PhD can be challenging, but you don't have to do it alone. Utilize these resources and support systems to enhance your research, broaden your network, and navigate your PhD journey more effectively.
